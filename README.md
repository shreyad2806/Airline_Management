# Airline_Management_System
Made an airline management system using Java Swing as front end and MySQL as backend
ABSTRACT
Today’s basic requirement under airline management system are passenger service system and revenue management system. We are presenting to you a desktop application with which we can:
1. Add all the available flights leaving for the exact time and destination, to the database.
2. Register all the passengers first to get the details of them and make it hassle free to afterwards book their tickets as many people only want to know about flight details but don't want to book them so we record only those who actually need to book tickets.
3. Book the tickets of intrested passengers who already have registered with their details to the airline's database.
4. There are always some unpredictable situations where we have to cancel plans, whether from passenger's side or  from Airline's side. To make it simple we have also made a Cancellation tab, from where passengers can cancel their booked tickets accordingly.

We have created this Airline management system with the help of many technical tools including — Java-Swing, MySQL, JDBC and many more.

The model I have used is Waterfall Model or Classic Life Cycle. In this model first of all the existed system is observed. Then customer requirements are taken in consideration then planning, modeling, construction and finally deployment.
 
DATABASE DESIGN
Structure of the database
 
These were the following tables we made using MySQL for the database
1.	Booking Table: named as `booking tbl`

2.	Cancellation Table: named as `cancellation id`

3.	Flights Table: named as flighttbl

4.	Passengers Table: named as passengerstbl 	

5.	Admin: a table to store admin login information named as adminlogin
